# SyncSemaphore
This repository contains a multi-threaded elevator simulation using semaphores, implemented in Python. The simulation consists of three threads: ascensoreThread, entrataPasseggeriThread, and discesaPasseggeriThread, which coordinate their actions using semaphores.

The simulation uses semaphores to control access to the elevator and protect shared data structures, and it simulates random passenger arrival and destination requests. The implementation can serve as an example of how to use semaphores to coordinate access to shared resources in a complex system like an elevator.

# Usage
To run the simulation, execute the elevator.py file or the .java file. The implementation requires Python 3 or Java to be installed on the system.
